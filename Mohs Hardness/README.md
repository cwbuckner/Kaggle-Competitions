# Summary:

The provided dataset involves predicting Mohs Hardness based on various chemical and elemental features. Exploratory data analysis includes understanding the dataset's structure, visualizing feature relationships, and conducting linear regression for prediction. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model for Mohs Hardness using the given features and evaluate its performance. Reflection involves assessing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the linear regression model on the test set and potential avenues for model improvement.

Dataset

- train.csv: the training dataset; Hardness is the continuous target
- test.csv: the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of Hardness
- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format
# Objective:

The primary goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting Mohs Hardness. This involves exploring the dataset, identifying relevant features, and training a linear regression model. The objective is to achieve accurate predictions on the test set, measured by the RMSE. The competition context emphasizes the potential use of the original dataset for training, allowing participants to explore differences and assess model performance improvements.

# Reflection:

The linear regression model is implemented, and its performance is evaluated using the RMSE metric. Reflection involves interpreting the results, considering potential areas for model enhancement, and exploring the impact of incorporating the original dataset in training. This process allows participants to iteratively refine their approach and gain insights into the predictive power of the chosen features. Feedback from the competition community can further guide improvements in the model, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning environment.
