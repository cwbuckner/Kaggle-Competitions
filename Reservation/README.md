# Summary:
This project revolves around predicting reservation cancellations, using a dataset derived from a deep learning model trained on the Reservation Cancellation Prediction dataset. The task involves training a logistic regression model to predict the 'booking_status.' The dataset includes various features such as the number of adults, lead time, and room type, with the goal of achieving accurate predictions on the test set.

Dataset:

- train.csv: the training dataset; booking_status is the target (e.g., whether the reservation was cancelled)
- test.csv: the test dataset; your objective is to predict booking_status
- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format

# Objective:
The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a reservation will be canceled ('booking_status'). The project starts with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and relationships between features. Subsequently, logistic regression is employed for modeling, and the impact of different feature combinations on model performance is explored. The ultimate aim is to submit predictions to Kaggle and achieve a high accuracy score.

# Reflection:
The analysis begins by loading and exploring the dataset, identifying key features, and visualizing relationships. Feature importance is examined through scatter plots and correlation coefficients. Logistic regression is chosen as the predictive model, and its performance is evaluated with different feature sets. The impact of feature selection on accuracy is highlighted, providing insights for model refinement.

Kaggle submission reflects the culmination of the project, with predictions generated and submitted for evaluation. The final Kaggle accuracy score serves as a quantitative measure of the model's success. The exploration of different scenarios with varying feature sets adds depth to the analysis, offering a comprehensive understanding of feature importance.

The project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques, showcasing the process of model development, evaluation, and submission in a competition setting. It provides a valuable learning experience for participants seeking to enhance their skills in predictive modeling.
